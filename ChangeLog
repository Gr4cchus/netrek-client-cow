	* socket.c: when RSA is not defined, a warning is generated for
	the prototype of handleRSAKey because it references a struct
	rsa_key_spacket which is not defined.  Moved the prototype into
	the #ifdef RSA.

	* socket.c: minor warning from casting in connect call.

	* input.c (initkeymap): getctrlkey() was being passed a "char *"
	instead of "unsigned char *".

	* main.c: include "defs.h" for getdefault() prototype.

	* docwin.c (loadxtrekrc): remove minor compiler warning.
	
	* config.h.in: remove superfluous definition of SIGSYS on Linux.

	* Makefile (distclean): add distclean target to comply with GNU
	package conventions.

	* configure.in: change testing of BSD signals in configure to
	shows an answer cache it.  From code contributed to Vanilla by
	Benjamin `Quisar' Lerman <quisar@quisar.ambre.net>

	* helpwin.c (help_message): rethink each help message, remove the
	word toggle and replace with on/off, as toggle is a technical
	term, remove mixed case descriptions in favour of lower case, move
	some verbs to the end of the message, and change the column fit
	algorithm to avoid overflow in normal and 800x600 mode.

	* input.c (keyaction): redirect keystrokes that would otherwise be
	ignored to be processed in the tactical window.  Novice users find
	it painful to have to put the cursor unnecessarily into the
	tactical window before pressing a key.

	* getname.c (handleWEvents): accept keystrokes from any netrek
	window during login, and refresh the development team text on the
	login window as soon as a redraw is required rather than waiting
	for the next second.

	* getname.c (loaddude): if server rejects guest login, allow the
	user to retry with a real name.  Current INL servers are coded to
	reject guest login.  Having to restart the client is unnecessary.

	* cowapi.h, data.c, data.h, defaults.c, main.c, socket.c: change
	-U to also adopt a local port number for TCP mode.

	* Makefile (dist): change dist and distdoc targets to generate a
	.tar.gz file that unpacks to a directory below the current
	directory.  Note: also writes the output kit file to the current
	directory rather than the directory above.

	* INSTALL: new file, standard generic installation instructions.

	* README: new file, explains the other important package
	documentation files.

	* ChangeLog: new file, a programmers change log as per GNU
	packaging standards and automated EMACS change log entry creation.

	* .cvsignore: add list of files to be ignored by CVS.
