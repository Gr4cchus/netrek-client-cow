	* newwin.c (newwin): Added code to just popup window saying SDL
	sound is an all or nothing option.

	* findslot.c (findslot):  #ifdef'd out Exit_Sound()

	* cowmain.c: #ifdef'd out Abort_Sound(), it's not need with
	SDL. #ifdef'd out Exit_Sound()

	* playback.c:  #ifdef'd out Abort_Sound(), it's not need with SDL

	* local.c: #ifdef'd out Abort_Sound(), it's not need with SDL

	* sound.c: Removed the ability to toggle sounds under SDL. It's an
	all or nothing thing now. If request, I'll make SDL work with
	Kurt's sound toggling code.

Fri Jun 21 02:40:55 2002  Bob Tanner  <tanner@real-time.com>

	* socket.c (doRead): An attempt to fix the full update bug
	(where's the bugzilla tracking number!) by reading 1024 bytes
	(BUFSIZE) for the socket instead of 768 bytes.

Fri Jun 21 00:43:53 2002  Bob Tanner  <tanner@real-time.com>
	* cow.spec: rolled new RPM from HEAD of cow tree

Thu Jun 16 02:31:27 2002  Bob Tanner  <tanner@real-time.com>
	* cow.spec: added cow.png and cow.desktop

Thu Jun 13 21:39:27 2002  Bob Tanner  <tanner@real-time.com>

	* Makefile (profile): Added 'make profile' to generate a netrek
	binary to we can compare cow with SDL_mixer vs cow with the old
	sound code.

Wed Jun 12 22:52:13 2002  Bob Tanner  <tanner@real-time.com>

	* playback.c (pbmain):  Converted enter_ship.wav

	* input.c (Key113): Converted self_destruct.wav

	* input.c (Key109): Converted message.wav

	* local.c (DrawMisc): Converted warning.wav

	* local.c (DrawPlasmaTorps): Converted plasma_hit.wav

	* local.c (DrawTorps): Converted torp_hit.wav

	* sound.h: added EXPLOSION_OTHER_WAV, PHASER_OTHER_WAV,
	FIRE_TORP_OTHER. and the code to load these new sounds.

	* local.c (DrawShips): Converted cloak.wav, uncloak.wav,
	shield_down.wav, shield_up.wav, explosion.wav,
	explosion_other.wav, phaser.wav, phaser_other.wav

	* cowmain.c (cowmain): Converted enter_ship.wav and engine.wav

	* sound.c: added isDirectory to check that the sounddir is
	actually a directory.

Tue Jun 11 01:10:51 2002  Bob Tanner  <tanner@real-time.com>

	* system.mk.in: Added SDL_CFLAGS, SDL_CONFIG, SDL_LIBS,
	SDL_MIXER_LIBS

	* sound.c: Added HAVE_SDL wrapper, initialization of SDL system,
	opening of audio device, and loading of 17 cow sounds.
	
	* cowmain.c (cowmain): HAVE_SDL wrapper to Init_Sound using SDL. I
	moved the Init_Sound method to right after readdefaults() so the
	intro can start playing ASAP.

	* configure.in: Added AC_CANONICAL_SYSTEM, added check for SDL, 
	add check for SDL_mixer.

	* config.h.in: add HAVE_SDL

	* spike: See spike/README for details

	* configure.in: --enable-unstable bug fix.

Tue Jul 24 14:47:50 2001  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* parsemeta.c: fix delay during UDP startup, by waiting up four
	seconds for the first response from a metaserver, and not waiting
	one second between processing X events on the window.Update the
	list properly on a refresh.  Fix empty window when the player is
	serviced by satellite delays.

	Change the colour on a server line to Cyan during a connection
	attempt to observe, and to Yellow during a normal connection
	attempt.  Change to Green on successful connection.  Change to Red
	if connection fails.
	
	Make better guesses as to the initial size of the window.  Tidy up
	messages, remove excess periods, and add warning about no return
	packets suggesting a firewall as the cause.
	
Tue Jun 12 16:32:48 2001  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* playback.c (pbmain): process all windowing events before
	proceeding to the next update, rather than just the one event.
	With pixmaps enabled on a playback, the event queue would grow
	causing the keystrokes to be ignored for many seconds.  Enabling
	pixmaps generates more events.

Tue Jun 12 12:03:42 2001  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* playback.c, input.c: add single-step playback keys, enter to
	step forward, backspace to step backward, and space to stop and
	start.

	Implemented as a flag (pb_stepping) that is non-zero when a step
	is in progress.  Once the next frame has been displayed, the flag
	is cleared and the playback pauses.  Required a minor change to
	input.c to catch keys that would otherwise be rejected because
	they were control characters.

Fri Apr 27 21:46:13 2001  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* socket.c: when RSA is not defined, a warning is generated for
	the prototype of handleRSAKey because it references a struct
	rsa_key_spacket which is not defined.  Moved the prototype into
	the #ifdef RSA.

	* socket.c: minor warning from casting in connect call.

	* input.c (initkeymap): getctrlkey() was being passed a "char *"
	instead of "unsigned char *".

	* main.c: include "defs.h" for getdefault() prototype.

	* docwin.c (loadxtrekrc): remove minor compiler warning.
	
	* config.h.in: remove superfluous definition of SIGSYS on Linux.

	* Makefile (distclean): add distclean target to comply with GNU
	package conventions.

	* configure.in: change testing of BSD signals in configure to
	shows an answer cache it.  From code contributed to Vanilla by
	Benjamin `Quisar' Lerman <quisar@quisar.ambre.net>

	* helpwin.c (help_message): rethink each help message, remove the
	word toggle and replace with on/off, as toggle is a technical
	term, remove mixed case descriptions in favour of lower case, move
	some verbs to the end of the message, and change the column fit
	algorithm to avoid overflow in normal and 800x600 mode.

	* input.c (keyaction): redirect keystrokes that would otherwise be
	ignored to be processed in the tactical window.  Novice users find
	it painful to have to put the cursor unnecessarily into the
	tactical window before pressing a key.

	* getname.c (handleWEvents): accept keystrokes from any netrek
	window during login, and refresh the development team text on the
	login window as soon as a redraw is required rather than waiting
	for the next second.

	* getname.c (loaddude): if server rejects guest login, allow the
	user to retry with a real name.  Current INL servers are coded to
	reject guest login.  Having to restart the client is unnecessary.

Fri Apr 27 11:34:50 2001  Benjamin `Quisar' Lerman  <quisar@quisar.ambre.net>

	* cowapi.h, data.c, data.h, defaults.c, main.c, socket.c: change
	-U to also adopt a local port number for TCP mode.
	
Thu Apr 26 15:52:16 2001  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* Makefile (dist): change dist and distdoc targets to generate a
	.tar.gz file that unpacks to a directory below the current
	directory.  Note: also writes the output kit file to the current
	directory rather than the directory above.

	* INSTALL: new file, standard generic installation instructions.

	* README: new file, explains the other important package
	documentation files.

	* ChangeLog: new file, a programmers change log as per GNU
	packaging standards and automated EMACS change log entry creation.

	* .cvsignore: add list of files to be ignored by CVS.
