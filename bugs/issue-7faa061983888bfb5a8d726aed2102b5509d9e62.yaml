title: ship an xtrekrc system-wide
desc: |-
  Customisation of the client using configuration files is possible, but
  without a system-wide xtrekrc file it is difficult for a user to discover
  how to begin customisation.
  
  1.  generate an xtrekrc file automatically during build,
  2.  place the file during install in /etc/netrek-client-cow/xtrekrc,
  3.  at startup, search for the file first in ~ then in /etc,
  4.  add customisation section to a manual page.
