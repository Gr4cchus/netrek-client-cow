    Text added to the name prompt as follows:
    
    Use guest if you do not want to have your statistics saved.
    Servers keep statistics by name.
    This is the name the server will remember you by.
    You may want to use an alias, most players do.
    If the name is known, the server will ask for your password.
    If not an account is created and you get to set a password.
