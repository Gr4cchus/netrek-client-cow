title: "incompatible with sturgeon mode server, LP #377482"
desc: |-
  netrek-client-cow 3.2.10
  
  On a sturgeon mode server, when trying to select a category for a
  upgrade, pressing the number key for the category applies the upgrade in
  the category that is the same as the number key for the category it is
  in.
  
  This is probably a feature of the Windows client that has not been
  backported.  The changes that created sturgeon mode in the current
  server source were made without corresponding changes to the COW client.
  
  Task is probably to determine how the Windows client handles the key
  sequence and then figure out how to have COW do the same thing.  A
  sturgeon developer is recommended.
  
  Problem does not reproduce with the closed source Paradise 2000 client.
  
  This bug is from LaunchPad bug #377482, which to be closed as logged
  upstream and unrelated to packaging.
