title: metaserver window misbehaves if quit while client connected
desc: |-
  The metaserver window remains on screen and is not updated.
  
  To reproduce, start the program, connect to a server (this forks a process
  for that session), then press quit on the metaserver window.

    Architectural change, program now forks and execs instead of only forking.
    Symptom no longer reproducible.
    
    Symptom was caused by window on X display shared by two connections.
