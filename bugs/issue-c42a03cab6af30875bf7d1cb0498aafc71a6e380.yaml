title: does not exit on 'q' due to SDL_WaitThread
desc: |-
  When user types 'q' to quit, the message "You Quit" is shown, but
  the client does not quit, and the server slot remains present.
  
  Workaround: add "sound: off" to ~/.xtrekrc
  
  Occurs with or without metaserver window.
  
  Occurs on Ubuntu Jaunty as of 2009-04-06, package version 3.2.9-1.
  
  Does not occur on Debian Squeeze as of 2009-04-06, package version 3.2.10-1.
  
  gdb backtrace at the time of the hang shows:
